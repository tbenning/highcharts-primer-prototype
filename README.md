# Primer Next.js Template 🐱⚛️

The quickest way to test out or prototype something in [Primer React](https://primer.style/react/) without having to set up a new project.

## Get Started (Codespaces)

1. Click `Code`
2. Click `new codespace`
3. Pick any machine type and click `create codespace`
4. Wait until the container is built and `Running postCreateCommand...` is finished running in the bottom `TERMINAL` panel.
5. Now in the `TERMINAL` panel write the `yarn start` command and hit enter.
6. When it's finished building your project click `Open` to open a preview of it. If this doesn't happen click `PORTS` in the bottom window and open the `Local Address` from there.
7. Now you are in Mona's playground 🎉 and you can start editing the `src/components/Playground.js` file to play around with Primer React.

## Get Started (Locally)

1. Clone the project
2. Run `yarn`
3. Run `yarn dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
5. Go to `src/pages/index.js` to start prototyping.

**Tip:** Add a new page in `src/pages` to create a new page.

## Why use Next.js?

This template is based on the existing Primer react-template, but built with Next.js instead. Recently, the React team started to [officially recommend](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) using a React-powered framework like Next.js to build sites. It has lots of advantages that make it easy to use, like simple routing for creating new pages and deploying your site live on Vercel.
